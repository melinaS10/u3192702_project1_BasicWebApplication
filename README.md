Back End Web Design
Project 1: Basic Web Application

Aim:
The aim of this project is to build a practical web application using the skills and techniques acquired in modules 1 and 2.

Task:
In this project, you will create a web application that allows a user to monitor something. Exactly what will be monitored is up to
you, but examples could include:
- an expenses tracker
- a to-do style application
- a recipes app
- a favourite takeaway location tracker
- even a university assignment due date tracker
- Another great idea..
.
At a minimum: the web application should allow a user to register, log in, add data to the database, retrieve data from the
database, edit and delete content and display the content on the front-end.

You will be required to write a short rationale (400-600 words) reflecting on the development process.
